# Open Letter - Mystery Shopping And The Government

Hi,

Okay, we really need to start addressing corruption with more than just "Fcuk, the Indian Government is so damn corrupt!" And no, iterations of non-constructive criticism is a huge waste of time, as we've seen before!

But let's step-aside for a bit and discuss a very popular retail technique that ensures quality of service and compliance with regulation - mystery shopping!

Though the phrase contains the word 'mystery,' there's actually very little mystery in the idea and implementation. And even less mystery in the results that may be achieved if done correctly.

Let me borrow from the Wikipedia article as they have a better proficiency at articulation:

*Mystery shoppers perform specific tasks such as purchasing a product, asking questions, registering complaints or behaving in a certain way, and then provide detailed reports or feedback about their experiences.*

Now, why am I rambling about this specific technique/process?

Because I feel it's a brilliant solution to attempt to curb corruption in the government. Imagine this - the government creates a special body of citizens that are picked at random to perform government-incentivized 'sting' operations to identify corrupt practises, officials and more! 

Awesome, it's so simple, let's write a letter to Narendra Modi and get on with it!

Umm, no.

Sure, the concept might actually work. But then I remember one of my most favourite quotes introduced to me by Dan Brown's Digital Fortress - *"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"* (which translates to - "Who will guard the guards?"). Yes, I am most definitely insinuating the possibility (or rather, the high probability) that corruption would be immediately and most efficiently introduced into this anti-corruption scheme. I mean, what else is the government really good at?

So now, you may be thinking "This guy wasted 5mins of our time talking about retail QoS techniques that can't be applied to the more important use-case - i.e. the government?"

Whoa, don't panic. Calm the f down.

All I insinuated is that if the government tries to keep a check on the government, it cannot be fair. It's like a murderer's wife telling the judge not to send her husband to prison because she'll make sure he doesn't murder anyone anymore.

### Solution to the problem

Create a web-application, linked to the Aadhar Card system wherein citizens are picked based on their social contributions, activity and other factors. So you now have an ever-growing pool of dutiful citizens per city, suppose. The web-application will, at random pick say, 10 citizens from the pool to go to various government offices and 'mystery shop' the government process, it's workers, etc. If the citizen finds anything even remotely fishy, they go back on the website and post about their experience.

### I know your next argument to this idea

You'll say "Who's going to keep the selected citizens from accepting bribe to cover things up?" Great question. But remember I was telling you about 'mystery shopping?' It's a real thing. It works. It helps businesses stay on top of issues. It helps them identify points of failure. 

It's simple really. You offer these citizens that uncover dirt (with proof) a reward that would be bigger than the bribe they would be alternatively offered. Yes, the government offers these rewards. They don't have to be monetary rewards. They could simply be a "Thank You" from the government. I mean, who doesn't want one of those?

### Architectural Nuances

- Identities of the 'government mystery shoppers,' (lets call them GMS) must be anonymous
- The pool has to consist of people that have actually contributed to the nation, to society
- The chosen citizens cannot be the same everytime, or it'll become obvious
- The reward must be substantial, again, without revealing their identities
- The spirit of patriotism must be brought into all this. To close the deal. Emotions are important.
- The program must be government sponsored
- The remaining citizens on the platform should have a say in the punishment (we're not taking it out of the hands of the judiciary but ALSO asking people what their opinion on the matter is)
- ... (Some people smarter than me can contribute more)
- Similarly, government officials that catch a person offering bribe should be able to report them and get a similar reward and media credit and a cooking show to themselves (kidding)

### Why?

Because it's high-fcuking-time. We don't want a leech-y government. We don't want to pay bribes. We do, because it's the quickest, easiest and least-risky way out. But why do that to us? If your officials were honest, there wouldn't be a situation where someone would feel like paying a bribe to "get on with it."
